Thinking about the "program"

Gettings Started Steps:

Intro

- We're reframing your goals as a "time" problem and that by re-allocating say 10 - 20% of your time toward helping other people achieve their goals, you can achieve your goals faster.

1. Understand your personal & professional goals
2. What are your motivations for achieving these goals?
3. What are the accomplishments you've made so far?
