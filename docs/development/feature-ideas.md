- [ ] Add "companies" tables that can be stored alongside the people.

This is helpful to see company history and company changes over time.

- [ ] AI business card import

Take a picture of a business card and upload it. The AI will be able to extract the information from the business card and add it to the person's profile.
We could also suggest possible connections or intro's, groups to add them to, or even immediate content / connection suggestions, if there are any accompanying notes.

- [ ] Add a "save this content" for a particular person. This will be on the AI side of the chat.

This is allowing the user to input a link or file or piece of content and save it for later. This could trigger additional suggestions or just save it for later usage.

- [ ] Audio transcription to text to create notes on the fly
