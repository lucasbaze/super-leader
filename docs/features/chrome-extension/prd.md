# Super Leader Chrome Extension PRD

## Overview

The Super Leader Chrome Extension is designed to seamlessly integrate with the main Super Leader application, allowing users to extract and process people's information from web pages directly into their Super Leader account. This extension serves as a bridge between web browsing and the Super Leader platform, enabling efficient data collection and profile creation.

## Goals

- Enable users to easily capture people's information from web pages
- Provide a seamless authentication experience connected to the main Super Leader platform
- Deliver an unobtrusive but accessible UI that integrates naturally with web browsing
- Automate the process of profile creation using AI/LLM capabilities

## User Requirements

### Authentication

- Users must be able to log in using their existing Super Leader account
- Authentication state should persist between browser sessions
- Users must be logged in to access any extension functionality

### UI/UX

- Panel Dimensions:
  - Width: 250-300 pixels
  - Height: Full viewport height
  - Position: Absolutely positioned on the right side
  - Spacing: 10px margin from top, right, and bottom edges
- Visual Design:
  - Floating appearance with shadow effect
  - Rounded borders
  - Consistent with Super Leader's design system
