My personal thoughts on this, or actually during the shower, the idea being that the homepage is really the activity actions page. This is going to suggest things to physically do. And the network will strictly be about metrics. The activity metrics, the view, the breadth, the depth, etc. So the homepage chat can just be simple chat, take actions, like add notes on anybody. And then on the network, that will be what I'm imagining from a visual perspective, the network view would be possibly akin to how we did the essay grading, where there's a basically nav bar on the left with the metrics, and each metric category has a color grade from red to green with a potential manual override option. And the metrics would be nested within there with an overall at the top would be overall metrics and then individual subcategory metrics. And that's where in this individual subcategory, I could see the, you know, the weekly activity, the monthly activity, etc. And I can see the metrics related to how my network is performing.
