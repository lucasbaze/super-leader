# Project Setup Log

## January 25, 2024

### Database Setup and Integration
1. Successfully integrated Supabase into the repository
   - Implemented Supabase clients for both web and mobile platforms
   - Resolved environment variable configuration challenges
   - Relocated Supabase configuration to root level for better organization

### Database Development
1. Created initial migration for messages table
   - Implemented as a public-facing policy table for testing
   - Successfully tested CRUD operations
   - Verified message creation and deletion functionality

### Package Management
1. Added essential Supabase packages:
   - Database client package
   - Type definition packages for database schema
   - Verified type package integration for future development

### Infrastructure
1. Environment Variable Management
   - Restructured environment variable setup
   - Resolved configuration issues across platforms

2. Deployment Pipeline
   - Completed first successful Supabase production deployment
   - Currently investigating GitHub Actions integration for Supabase deployments
   - Planning CI/CD pipeline improvements for automated migration deployments
   - Temporary solution: Local deployment capability established

3. EAS Environment Configuration
   - Successfully configured environment variables in EAS system
   - Set up Supabase production environment variables
   - Set up Supabase staging environment variables
   - Verified environment variable injection into builds
   - Enhanced `app.config.js` for environment-specific variable injection
   - Implemented dynamic environment selection via flags (e.g., `EAS update --env production`)
   - Verified production database connection through Expo Go

### Current Status
- Supabase Integration: ✅ Complete
- Database CRUD Operations: ✅ Tested
- Environment Setup: ✅ Configured
- Production Deployment: ✅ Initial Push Complete
- CI/CD Pipeline: ⏳ In Progress
- EAS Environment Variables: ✅ Configured
- Production Build Process: ✅ Verified
- Local Development Flow: ✅ Working
- Preview Environment: ⏳ Pending Setup

### Next Steps
1. Implement automated Supabase deployment in CI/CD pipeline
2. Research previous project implementations for CI/CD reference
3. Enhance environment variable management in deployment workflow
4. Configure preview environment setup
5. Document deployment procedures for team reference

### Initial Project Setup
1. Used TurboRepo React Native Next.js starter template from Vercel
2. Deployed initial project through Vercel
3. Cloned repository locally
4. Installed dependencies using `yarn`
5. Successfully launched development environment with `yarn dev`

### Development Environment
- Xcode was previously installed, enabling smooth iOS development workflow
- Verified iOS simulator functionality
- Confirmed hot reload functionality working as expected on:
  - Web interface
  - iOS simulator
- Successfully upgraded Expo to latest version
- Installed Expo Go on physical iPhone device
- Verified development build accessibility on personal iPhone through Expo Go
- Implemented GitHub Actions workflow:
  - Configured automatic preview deployment builds
  - Set to trigger on pull requests
  - Streamlines development and review process

### Build Configuration
1. Initiated EAS (Expo Application Services) build setup
2. Successfully created initial development build
3. **Current Blocker**: Apple Developer Account
   - Need to obtain Apple Developer account credentials
   - Required for TestFlight deployment and App Store publishing
   - Currently limited to development builds and Expo environment
   - Research indicates paid Apple Developer account required even for internal distribution[^1]
   - Once account is obtained, can set up internal distribution for team testing

### Current Status
- Development environment: ✅ Functional
- Local testing: ✅ Operational
- Hot reload: ✅ Working
- Build pipeline: ✅ Initial setup complete
- App Store deployment: ⏳ Pending Apple Developer Account
- Expo Go testing: ✅ Working on physical device
- CI/CD: ✅ GitHub Actions configured for preview builds

### Next Steps
1. Obtain Apple Developer Account
2. Configure TestFlight deployment
3. Prepare for App Store submission
