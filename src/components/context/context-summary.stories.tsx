                "People with the INFJ personality type (Advocates) rarely settle for shallow, superficial friendships. When it comes to social fulfillment, they aren't satisfied by casual interactions with colleagues or classmates. INFJ personalities crave authentic, meaningful friendships â€“ friendships that allow them to share their dreams, bare their soul, and feel understood and accepted for who they are. And if that means having just one or two confidants rather than a wide circle of acquaintances, so be it."

Few things bring them more pleasure or delight than talking through their passions, interests, and beliefs with a kindred spirit. People with this personality type enjoy the pleasure of their own company, but they still find it liberating to let their guard down and be completely and utterly themselves with a friend who they know they can trust.'

                "INFJs are known for having great expectations â€“ not just for themselves but also for their friendships. High on this list of expectations is authenticity. If they have to be fake or tone themselves down to gain someone's approval, then that person probably isn't the best friend for them. And it's hard for people with this personality type to respect someone who isn't also an authentic and honest person themselves."

They want to surround themselves with friends who inspire them to learn, expand, and improve themselves. For INFJs, the surest way for two friends to deepen their bond is by helping each other move forward on their respective life missions."

INFJs often feel that it's difficult to meet the sort of friends that they're seeking â€“ friends who share the same idealistic values. As a result, people with this personality type may sometimes worry that they need to settle for less-than-fulfilling friendships â€“ or else accept being alone."

When they give these strangers a chance, INFJ personalities may find that they share values and attitudes that make them compatible on a deeper level."
