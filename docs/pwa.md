# Progressive Web App Setup

This document describes the configuration necessary for the Superleader application to behave as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## Implemented requirements

- Added `next-pwa` to generate a service worker during production builds.
- Created `public/manifest.json` with name, icons and theme color so the app can be installed on mobile home screens.
- Updated `next.config.ts` to enable the PWA plugin when not in development mode.
- Updated `src/app/layout.tsx` metadata so browsers automatically load the manifest and icons.

## Additional requirements not implemented

- No mobile specific styling or layout changes were included.
- Advanced offline caching strategies (e.g. dynamic data storage) were not configured. The default `next-pwa` caching behavior will handle static assets only.
