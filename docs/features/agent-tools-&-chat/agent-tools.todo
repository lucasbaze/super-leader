Now:
  ☐ Need to get the AI to ask follow up questions after creating an interaction somehow.
  ☐ Need to figure out a way to not say "User did x" and use the actual name of the user?
  ☐ Ability to update the last note or a note via the chat to fix things or delete the note.
  ☐ Add ability to update the person's name, birthday, date met, addresses, emails, contact methods, & websites via the chat interface.
  ☐ Need to add ability to transcribe audio into text using the chat interface
  ☐ AI can support standard fields: updating name, birthday, date met, addresses, emails, contact methods, & websites.
  ☐ Need the AI to be able to update the custom fields if necessary
  ☐ Call the "initial-message" tool when the user first opens the chat if it's been more than 1 day since the last interaction.

Bugs: 
  ☐ See bugs in development/todo/today.md
