**Taxonomy, Hierarchy, and Structure of Relationship Metrics**  
_(Explained Like You’re 5)_

---

### **1. The "Circles of Connection" (5+50+100 Rule)**

Think of your network like a target with 3 rings:

- **Inner Circle (5):** Your ride-or-dies. _Inputs:_ Trust score, shared secrets, late-night calls.
- **Key Allies (50):** Trusted advisors. _Inputs:_ Frequency of brainstorming, favors exchanged.
- **Vital 100:** Broad network. _Inputs:_ Event invites, LinkedIn interactions.  
  _Problem it solves:_ "Am I leaning too much on the same people?"

**Visualization:**

- A dartboard 🎯 with glowing rings.
- Colors fade if a circle is neglected.
- _Feeling:_ "My inner circle is _glowing_ today!"

### **2. "Garden Health" Metrics**

**Strategic vs. Operational:**

- **Strategic Flowers 🌸 (long-term):** Investors, mentors.
- **Operational Weeds 🌱 (daily grind):** Vendors, assistants.  
  _Problem:_ "Am I watering weeds instead of flowers?"

**Quality vs. Quantity:**

- **Golden Apples 🍎 (high-impact):** CEOs who return calls.
- **Rotten Apples 🍏 (time-wasters):** People who ghost you.  
  _Visual:_ A tree with fruit. Rotting fruit falls with a _splat_ sound.

**Growth vs. Maintenance:**

- **Seedlings 🌱 (new connections):** Met at last event.
- **Watering Cans 🚰 (nurtured):** Check-ins this month.  
  _Feeling:_ "Time to plant more seeds!"

### **3. "Superpower" Metrics**

**Network Breadth (Diversity):**

- _Inputs:_ Industry, ethnicity, gender, age.
- _Visual:_ A "spice rack" 🌶️—each spice is a unique group.
- _Feeling:_ "My network’s too vanilla!"

**Connector Score 🧲:**

- _Inputs:_ Introductions made, deals sparked.
- _Visual:_ Lightning bolts between people.
- _Problem:_ "Am I a bridge or an island?"

### **4. Group Variants**

**"Circle of 50" Health:**

- _Inputs:_ Response time, shared wins.
- _Visual:_ A campfire 🔥—bright = strong, dim = weak.
- _Sound:_ Crackling fire = healthy, silence = trouble.

**"Circle of 100" Health:**

- _Inputs:_ Event attendance, referrals.
- _Visual:_ A party 🎉—confetti bursts for activity.

### **Visualization Principles**

- **Krug’s "Don’t Make Me Think":**
  - Icons over text (e.g., 💼 = CEOs, 🌍 = global).
  - Red/yellow/green "traffic lights" for quick status.
- **UX Principles:**
  - Haptic feedback (phone buzzes if inner circle is ignored).
  - Voice assistant: "Your network breadth is _spicy_ today!"

### **Dashboard Prompt for v0**

**"Design an executive dashboard that feels like a living garden. Use:**

- **Metaphors:** Trees for growth, bridges for connections.
- **Emotions:** Warm colors for strong ties, cold for weak.
- **Gamification:** Badges (‘Master Connector’), progress bars.
- **Sensory UX:** Subtle sounds (wind chimes for new links) and animations (lightning bolts for introductions).  
  Each section should _itch_ if neglected—like a plant begging for water."

**Output:** A dashboard where CEOs _feel_ their network’s pulse, not just analyze it. 🌐✨
