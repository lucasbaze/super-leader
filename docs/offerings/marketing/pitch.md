# Pitch

1. I going to solve relationship management for entreprenuers and young executives.

These folks succeed based on the quality of their relationships. How many people know, like, and trust them.

And they know thousands of people, but memory and time degrade quality of the relationships quickly.

The main tools available are CRMs which are sales tools and not relationship tools. These folks are in sales, but not direct sales operations. So they need a tool like a CRM, but one designed specifically for them.

My first startup out of college was this exact problem, and I've tried dozens of systems, and I've probably missed dozens of opportunities over the years because I haven't been able to find a system that works.

That's where Superleader comes in.

Superleader is an AI first relationship manager that is designed to proactively find, nurture, and scale your network.

This is something that every executive would use, it just needs to work well, and AI finally makes that possible.

## Pitch for Engrs

Engineers want to work on hard problems, with other people that are smart, working with the newest technologies, making a difference for their customers / clients.

1. I'm an engineer, and know the roadmap for the product.
2. I'm solving a problem that I've had for years.
3. The product is very straightforward in the problems it needs to solve:

Phase 1:

- Agregate your contacts & messages & calendar invites
- Read those messages and contacts and suggest actions: Follow ups, introductions, meetings, etc...

Phase 2:

- It needs to source the internet and provie updates on people & organizations you're interested in
- It needs to enable to search and find people that I'm looking for

Phase 3:

- It needs to be fully accessible on the go.
- It needs to be able to work with other folks / teams that I'm apart of.
- It needs to be able to integrate with other tools that I use to move info in and out as needed.

Key Engineering Challenges:

- Syncing and keeping track of people across all the tools they use (Slack, Outlook, Google Calendar, etc...)
  - Integrating these sources properly and adding in the AI middleman to make the magic happen.
- Prompting the right way to get the right summarizations and information.
- Determining what is actionable / not actionable.
