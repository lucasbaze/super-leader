Groups vs. labels

From Judy Robbinnett thinking about the robustness / depth of the network...

If I'm aiming for ~20 people in each of the 8 ecosystems, how does the system "determine" who is these ecosystems? How do I know who is in each of these ecosystems? How is it separate from the groups vs. labels?

I could just add a default "ecosystem" dropdown label...

A group is a collection of people that you want to actively keep track of...

- Will show up in the "network" view
- Will show up in stats

Labels are for 2nd degree filtering / sorting / finding people.

- User can create labels as needed, the AI can also create labels as needed.

In an AI world, do we need labels? The AI can just create them as needed?
