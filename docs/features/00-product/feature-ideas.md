## AI business card import

Take a picture of a business card and upload it. The AI will be able to extract the information from the business card and add it to the person's profile.
We could also suggest possible connections or intro's, groups to add them to, or even immediate content / connection suggestions, if there are any accompanying notes.

## Add a "save this content" for a particular person. This will be on the AI side of the chat.

This is allowing the user to input a link or file or piece of content and save it for later. This could trigger additional suggestions or just save it for later usage.

## Relationship Mapping

Thoughts:
☐ Adding the "initial message" prompt for each person is interesting... It makes me think that the AI should be "incrementally" building the profile... which means I need to figure out the right way to do that...

- i.e. Are they in the right "bucket". How well do you know this person? Are you building a "relationship" with them or maintaining one?
- How well does this person know you?
  Need to think about these further "building" type questions... Might affect the summary as well...

## Interaction counts

☐ Adding a contact information, address, or website should could as an "interaction" or at the very least update the summary of the person in some way... probably both honestly...
