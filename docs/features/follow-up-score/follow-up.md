What I want to do here is calculate a new field value, basically called a follow-up score. The follow-up score will range from 0 to 100, from 0 to 1. 0 will mean you're good and you don't have to follow up with them, and 1 will mean you should follow up today. What we'll do is we'll basically just collect a bunch of information and then send it to an ASK, an AI model to basically calculate a score for us with general kind of recommendations. The input information will be the interactions, the group that they're in, for example 550 or 100, we'll look at their last interactions, and then an order of priority. So if there are any, so I'll fetch any, we would fetch technically any preset reminders, so if there are any preset reminders, you would automatically define that as a 1. If there are any preset events, for example counter events, then we would automatically set those accordingly. If there's any birthdays, we'd set those as well. So anything that would be hard set that we can just calculate, we'll do that. Everything else there would be basically a general follow-up, so to speak. And so to determine that general follow-up, what we can do is we can create this follow-up score with the inputs being the group, the last interactions, and maybe some general information about that person that we have, like the AI summary, and then let the AI determine if the follow-up is warranted at the moment. And that score will then translate into on the client side a very simple color gradient from green to red, along that gradient of 0 to 1, with 0 being green and 1 being red. As a follow-up today.

The user will be able to override the score, and they will be able to set the score to a custom value if they want to.

We'll only need to update this value. We can have this as a single endpoint for the time being.

I will need to figure out how to run test using OpenAI during the test runs.
