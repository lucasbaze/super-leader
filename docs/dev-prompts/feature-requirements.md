# Feature Requirements Questions

Objective: To define requirements for a new feature within an existing product.
Uses: Creating feature specifications, planning feature development, and ensuring alignment with product goals.

Example build process: https://www.loom.com/share/864f572d601f4c838bf4fc13c85ff88d

## Feature Purpose

Key Questions:

- What specific problem does this feature solve?
- How does this feature align with the product's goals?
- Why is this feature needed now?
- What happens if we don't build this feature?
- How does this fit into the existing user experience?
- What value does this add for users?
- How urgent is this feature?
- What alternatives were considered?

## User Impact

Key Questions:

- Which user segments will use this feature?
- How will users discover this feature?
- What user pain points does it address?
- How will this change user behavior?
- What learning curve should we expect?
- What user feedback led to this feature?
- How will this affect existing workflows?
- What resistance might users have?

## Success Metrics

Key Questions:

- What data needs to be tracked?
- How will this affect performance?

## Implementation Details

Key Questions:

- What is the smallest viable version?
- What edge cases must be handled?
- What error states are possible?
- How should errors be handled?
- What permissions are needed?
- What settings should be configurable?
- What defaults should be set?
- How will this be tested?

## UX / UI

Key Questions:

- How should the user interface look and feel?
