SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Start Local Engagement:  
   – Join your local chamber of commerce or economic development council to find real estate developers, government officials, and family office representatives.

2. Host a Topic-Focused Meetup:  
   – Combine your passions (Bitcoin + real estate + human-centric design) and host a small event. Invite those you’d like to know better (and encourage them to bring a plus-one).

3. Seek Out a Mentor:  
   – Identify one or two people who have successfully navigated both business building and spiritual depth—someone who can bridge the gap for you. Consider local entrepreneurs or philanthropists with similar values.

4. Travel / Explore Beyond Cypress:  
   – If Cypress doesn’t have the ecosystem, plan regular trips into central Houston, Austin, or College Station. Attend bigger meetups, conferences, or roundtables.

5. Document & Reflect:  
   – Keep a journal or dedicated digital log of your networking efforts. Track who you meet, what value you share, and what you learn.

By following this strategic relationship map, you’ll systematically build a network aligned with your values—long-term thinking, community orientation, and commitment to designing a better future. You’ll connect with the right mentors, investors, policy makers, and thinkers to grow Superleader, support your family, and continue evolving spiritually and professionally.

---First Principle Questions---

- What categories of people should I be looking for? and why?
- What dimensions in those categories should I be looking for? and why?

- How many people should I have in each category across the dimensions?

- How do I find these people? ( Suggested Events, Groups, etc.)
- Who do I try to connect with first? ( People that share my values... )
- How do I get these people to know, like, & trust me? ( Share, Value-add, Ask )
- How do I get these people to want to help me?

Core Ideas:

- You have some social capital, but other's have much more. Build it, Buy it, Borrow it.

Gamification Ideas:

- Make it "interactive" by:

  - asking the user to provide any additional categories and dimensions.
  - "Checking" off or asking the person to simply input a "name" of a person that comes to mind for each category and dimension?

- Ask further questions:
  - Sliding scale for the user to set their "social capital" score?
  - Sliding scale for them to set their "networking skill" score?

Actions:

- Upon creating the categories, we'll create a custom field with values for each category.
- We'll also save an object map of the category name & the "target value" for each one on the user profile.
- We'll save the Share, Value-Add, Ask to the user-profile.
- We'll save the summary of the person to the user-profile and calculate the completeness score.
