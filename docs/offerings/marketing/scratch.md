Why Now:

Window of opportunity to work together before in a close way:

The Big Shift:

- You and I both believe that AI will radically transform the world of work and what humans work on.

We're seeing the shifts already:

- AI job postings are up 68% year over year while the market is down 10% year over year.
- All tech companies are laying off or basically freezing hiring.
- A new AI product is launching basically every week that can do things we didn't think were possible.

Everyone is asking, "What is the future of work going to look like in an AI world?"

I don't have the answer to that, but what I do know is that the need for strategic access to the right people is only going to grow. No matter how much AI there is, we're still driven by biology, and people want to invest in other people. Our time, talent, and energy is limited, so we need to be strategic about how we invest it.

"Big Idea"

- For builders, who are activley building businesses and products, Superleader is an extremely exclusive software and community designed to scale you and get you access to the right people.

- Unlike other networking programs, Superleader is only for those who demonstrate they understand the value and importance of strategic relationships.

Secret Sauce: (Show Superleader in action)

- So how would this program work?
- Very simple: First we build your plan together ( just like a financial planner or a personal trainer )
- We identify your goals, we'll inventory your network, and we'll build a network plan / map to achieve those goals.
- Then we put the plan into action through the Superleader software.

- If you're always hunting... you're not able to farm for the long term.
- But if you're always farming... you're not hunting for new opportunities.
  It's a balance.

- First, you'd get the Superleader software ( short demo )

  - This is AI tool that will be at the center of our program
  - It's job is to radically simplify your networking and relationship building.
  - AI native, Context aware, and plugged into all your existing tools.

- Then, we'd build your plan together.

  - This plan is how you're going to achieve your goals through strategic partnerships and relationships.
  - We'd have 3 sessions: Where you are, How you got here, and where you're going.

- You'd get access to the Superleader community

  - This is the exclusive other members in the Superleader program

- The secret sauce is the AI relationship manager.

- The first step is to get the software in your hands.

- Opinionated based on the work of How to Be a Power Connector
- AI native software
- Will be available only to superleaders

- If you're heads down in the trenches building, then maybe now isn't the right time.
- But if you're interested in

Offer:

- You'd get the software tool ( doing the lion's share of the work )
- You'd get access to the community (TBD)
- You'd get 24/7 access to me (which you already have ;)
- You'd get a personalized plan for you and your business ( We'd build this together in our first sessions )
- You'd get a 2, 30 minute checkins with me
- You'd get at least 2 strategic introductions per month from the super leader network

That being said, I'm only taking on 1 new client per month, so unless you're serious about this, please don't apply.

Misc:

- For builders, who are actively building.
- My idea is to build superleader, an AI relationship manager to help you build your network and thus your business.
  Unlike CRM or Social, Superleader is designed for you to make your personal dreams come true in a way that is authentic and scalable.
- The ideas is AI native software available exclusively to superleaders. Not available to the masses. So every user is a superleader, and the system can additionally help connect you to each other.
