1. 100% needs a video of the product as a demo... I can't stand not being able to see the product in action before I try it.

Ideas:

- Could add some type of fun AI referall mechanism? Skip the line if?
- Can auto link to a calendly to book a demo.

Video Elements:

- Connected to calendar & email for ingestion? This is going to be a big thing. Can it be "mocked" for demo purposes?
- Chat with the AI

- Highlight the key worfklows
  - Adding new people, following up, etc...?
- Show the AI in action ✔️
  - Personal summaries ✔️
- How it's organized? ✔️
- That Superleader knows you and your needs

- "Custom fields"?

Superleader combines it's knowledge about you with the knowledge of your network to provide the most personalized experience and relationship building system to make you a Superleader.

Show don't tell:

- Show the summary view of the person plus my goals and memory notes ( as seen in the chat image )
  - Superleader knows you and your needs. An AI that is always contextual and knows you and your network.
  - Speak to the AI via voice would be super cool to add context notes about myself as a person.
- Briefly show the organized into 3 groups: 5, 50, 100 based on Judy Robinett's How to Be a Power Connector
  - Show a single person view: Activity, Summary, Tasks, Suggestions?
  - Speak to the AI via voice would be super cool to find gift ideas
  - Could show the "gmail" icon for "email", and the "google calendar" icon for the "calendar" event activity
- Then show that these two things ( details about each person and you as a person ) enable Superleader to provide suggestions on tasks, follow ups, and networking opportunities.

  - Show the home view & tasks

- Show the "integrations" page for email & calendar, and LinkedIn that's linked.

- What's coming "next":
  - Sourcing and finding people
  - Sending messages
  - Mobile application

Clean ups:

- Clean up the table views
- Clean up the images of the people
- Fix the Summary view & Networking Map functionality

What's the most important thing to "understand" about the product?

- It's using AI to accomplish tasks
