We'll re-use the Split Layout from the Onboarding flow.

In the left section, we'll keep the same contents as the current onboarding-progress.tsx component.

In the right section, we'll use the tab component to switch between the following tabs:

- Share, Value-Add, & Ask,
- Relationship Map
- Superleader playbook

Each section will have a title and a description for that section.

The remaining content will be variable content based on the selected tab.
