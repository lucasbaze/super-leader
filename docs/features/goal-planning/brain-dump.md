## Dump Thoughts

In order to do the agent, sorry, the goal planning, my thought was what two thoughts. One is maybe I could create the agent calling the agent type of workflow. So I could leave the entry point as the main chat and then it just simply calls the like you know goal builder chat that could be a separate kind of pathway.

I could just have a separate chat endpoint in a separate UI interface like for example if I did it in an overlay window in the settings for example. I think that might break the kind of initial user experience but it's definitely possible.

The idea being that I could use the same idea as the summarization. So the prompt is constantly asking questions of the user to determine how determine what types of questions to ask next to really try to get to a certain quote-unquote completion score of like say 90% of context about the person. Then the summarization prompt is really creating a summary of the person. So their goals, their life, their history, their fears, their worries, their anxieties, their who they are as a person.

That all would separately get funneled into a plan that would then describe what events they need to go to, the people they need in their network, etc. That's going to require a combination of having access to their network already. So this plan can really only get built after having taken the initial sets of measurements. Who's in your network? How complete is it? What do you know about these people? Etc.

This is the same thing as a doctor saying, "Okay, I need to take certain measurements about you as an individual before I can make a prescription."

The AI is going to take the context about you as an individual plus your network and the information about the people within your network and then create a plan from that.The plan realistically would be you know people events the cadence network structure the locations to participate in basically how do you get into the right rooms.

The goal planner should also be questioning and asking and making sure that your goals and objectives are across multiple domains. So not just your professional goals, but your personal goals, your spiritual goals, your religious goals, your community goals, etc. All of these goals will need to be long-term goals because they're going to take long-term relationship building in order to accomplish them. So it's not something that's going to be "I can do this overnight," but it might take a year or plus.

And then the plan is really just going to be providing the actions. So there's going to be a plan to get people when we're building our new network. There'll be a plan to keep people how we're going to do that on an ongoing basis. Maybe that's dinners, maybe that's the general process of using the tool, etc. And then we're going to have a plan to grow the network. So who are the types of, you know, where do we need to be, how do we need to make the network more effective, introductions we need to make and making a plan for basically each one of those phases.

Results = Energy x Focus x Consistency x Systems

Results = Goals
Focus = Plan
Systems = Superleader
Energy + Consistency = You
