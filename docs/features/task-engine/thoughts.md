The "daily" cadence makes me think that a "today" view really would make sense.

At least 5 actions per day.

Operational:

- Event calendar / dossier
- Messages to follow up on

Relationship Building:

- Suggested introductions
- Suggested people to follow up with
- Things to "prepare" for during the week for any specific people
- Gifts to buy for any specific people
- Upcoming anniversaries
- News events that are relevant to any specific people / companies
- Prioritize new people to follow up and create value for them somehow
  - I.e. new people that were added via LinkedIn or something.

CRM Maintenance:

- New information to add to any individual people
- Questions to anwer about a specific person to add more information to their dossier

This also makes me think that the right "output" would actually be more like a an executive summary.
With action items and decisions that the user can take / needs to make.

Like a document that says:

Hello John / Happy Monday John / Good day John / etc.

You have a busy week ahead of you. / You have a light day today. / I have today's action plan for you.

To help with your goals (we're going to do XYZ)
Today's a routine day today.
Mostly routine maintenance and follow ups.
Found some opportunities to make introductions.

Here's what we're doing today:

Let me know if you have any questions.

Actions "roll over" to the next day if they're not actively "snoozed", "completed", or "skipped".

"Upcoming" tasks tab is broken down by the day, but not "wrapped" in the context... it could be though?

Here are your reminders that you asked about specifically. Any action on these items?

Stages:

- User is still "onboarding"
- User has been "onboarded" and is taking consistent action every day
- User is falling off the wagon and not taking the requisite actions daily
