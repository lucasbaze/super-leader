### Taxonomy, Hierarchy, and Structure of Relationship and Networking Metrics

To create an **executive dashboard** that feels genuinely human and intuitive, we’ll break down the metrics into **taxonomy, hierarchy, and structure** based on Judy Robinett’s principles from _How to Be a Power Connector_. The goal is to make the dashboard **feel** like a natural extension of the user’s network, providing actionable insights and emotional resonance.

### **1. Taxonomy of Metrics**

The metrics are categorized into **strategic, operational, quality, quantity, growth, and maintenance** dimensions. Each metric is designed to provide a **holistic view** of the network’s health and potential.

#### **Strategic Metrics**

- **Network Breadth**: Diversity of individuals in your network.

  - _Inputs_: Number of unique industries, geographies, roles, and backgrounds.
  - _Problem/Challenge_: Low breadth = limited access to novel ideas or introductions.
  - _Visualization_: A **radar chart** showing diversity across categories (e.g., industry, geography).

- **Network Depth**: Strength of relationships within your network.

  - _Inputs_: Frequency of interactions, trust levels, mutual value exchanges.
  - _Problem/Challenge_: Low depth = weak relationships that may not yield support when needed.
  - _Visualization_: A **heatmap** showing relationship strength across key contacts.

- **Influence Score**: The ability to mobilize your network for action.
  - _Inputs_: Number of introductions made, responses to requests, and outcomes.
  - _Problem/Challenge_: Low influence = inability to leverage network for opportunities.
  - _Visualization_: A **bar chart** showing influence scores for key individuals or groups.

#### **Operational Metrics**

- **Engagement Rate**: Frequency and quality of interactions.

  - _Inputs_: Emails, calls, meetings, and social media interactions.
  - _Problem/Challenge_: Low engagement = relationships may fade.
  - _Visualization_: A **line graph** showing engagement trends over time.

- **Response Time**: How quickly your network responds to your requests.
  - _Inputs_: Average time to reply to emails, calls, or messages.
  - _Problem/Challenge_: Slow response = low priority in your network.
  - _Visualization_: A **gauge** showing average response time.

#### **Quality vs. Quantity Metrics**

- **Quality**: Value of individual relationships.

  - _Inputs_: Mutual value exchanges, trust, and reciprocity.
  - _Problem/Challenge_: Low quality = relationships may not yield meaningful outcomes.
  - _Visualization_: A **scatter plot** showing quality vs. quantity of relationships.

- **Quantity**: Size of your network.
  - _Inputs_: Total number of contacts, LinkedIn connections, etc.
  - _Problem/Challenge_: High quantity with low quality = diluted network.
  - _Visualization_: A **pie chart** showing distribution of contacts by category.

#### **Growth vs. Maintenance Metrics**

- **Growth**: Rate of new connections and opportunities.

  - _Inputs_: Number of new contacts, introductions, and opportunities generated.
  - _Problem/Challenge_: Low growth = stagnant network.
  - _Visualization_: A **bar chart** showing monthly growth trends.

- **Maintenance**: Effort to sustain existing relationships.
  - _Inputs_: Number of follow-ups, check-ins, and value-added interactions.
  - _Problem/Challenge_: Poor maintenance = relationships may weaken.
  - _Visualization_: A **calendar view** showing upcoming follow-ups.

### **2. Hierarchy of Metrics**

The hierarchy organizes metrics by **individuals, groups, and the entire network**, ensuring visibility at every level.

#### **Individual Metrics**

- **Health Score**: Overall strength of a relationship.

  - _Inputs_: Engagement, trust, and mutual value.
  - _Visualization_: A **progress bar** for each contact.

- **Value Exchange**: What you’ve given vs. received.
  - _Inputs_: Introductions, advice, resources exchanged.
  - _Visualization_: A **donut chart** showing balance.

#### **Group Metrics**

- **Circle of 50**: Key relationships that require regular attention.

  - _Inputs_: Engagement, influence, and value exchange.
  - _Visualization_: A **network graph** showing connections within the circle.

- **Circle of 100**: Broader network that provides diverse opportunities.
  - _Inputs_: Diversity, engagement, and growth.
  - _Visualization_: A **bubble chart** showing group dynamics.

#### **Network Metrics**

- **Network Health**: Overall strength and potential of your network.

  - _Inputs_: Breadth, depth, influence, and engagement.
  - _Visualization_: A **dashboard summary** with key KPIs.

- **Opportunity Pipeline**: Potential opportunities generated by your network.
  - _Inputs_: Introductions, collaborations, and deals.
  - _Visualization_: A **funnel chart** showing opportunities at each stage.

### **3. Structure of Metrics**

The structure ensures the dashboard is **intuitive, actionable, and emotionally resonant**.

#### **Visualization**

- **Icons**: Use icons to represent key metrics (e.g., a handshake for engagement, a globe for diversity).
- **Colors**: Green = healthy, yellow = needs attention, red = critical.
- **Words**: Use simple, human-centric language (e.g., “Your network is thriving!” or “Time to reconnect with your Circle of 50”).
- **Images**: Include avatars or photos of key contacts to make it personal.

#### **Feeling**

- **Progress**: Show progress toward goals (e.g., “You’ve added 10 new connections this month!”).
- **Gratitude**: Highlight positive outcomes (e.g., “Your introduction led to a $1M deal!”).
- **Urgency**: Flag areas needing attention (e.g., “Your Circle of 50 engagement is low”).

### **Prompt for v0 Dashboard Variations**

**Prompt**:  
“Create multiple variations of an **executive dashboard** for network analytics. The dashboard should feel **human-centric**, intuitive, and actionable. Use **icons, colors, and images** to make it visually engaging. Include metrics for **network breadth, depth, influence, engagement, and growth**. Organize the metrics by **individuals, groups, and the entire network**. Ensure the dashboard provides a **holistic view** of the network’s health and potential, with clear **visualizations** (e.g., radar charts, heatmaps, network graphs) and **emotionally resonant language** (e.g., ‘Your network is thriving!’ or ‘Time to reconnect with your Circle of 50’).”

This structure ensures the dashboard is not just functional but also **feels** like a natural extension of the user’s network, providing actionable insights and emotional resonance.
