# Metrics

## Profile Completeness

- This metric is measuring the completeness of a single person's "profile".

### Inputs

- The birthday, contact-methods, addressses, etc...
- The "completness" of the the following dimensions / key questions below
- The previous ai_summary
- The most recent 10-20 interactions? ( add an "enhanced" interaction summary)

### Outputs

- A single score between 0 and 100.
- A summary of the person's profile across each category.

- Looking at the image, the data structure probably looks something like:

```
isProcessing
data: {
"completeness": number,
"highlights": markdown string
"groupedSections": [
  {
    sections: [
      {
        title: the name of the section ( keep it concise )
        icon: emoji or character that expresses the section
        content: markdown string,
        forYou: markdown of "insights" that could be useful to you as the user about the person. i.e. what you are trying to accomplish combined with what the system knows about them. Shoot.. even how you feel toward them. (friendly, wary etc... could be insightful to the system. )
      },
    ],
    suggestions: {
      content: markdown string,
      reason: markdown string
    }
  }
],
```

I want to hanve the "info" returned as markdown, so that I can more easily parse it?
Give the AI more leeway interms of the structure of the information. (Also, gives me more incentize for further personalization of the output format. )

### Updates

- On adding a new interaction, should we automatically update the profile completeness?
  ( I could do a small model first that determines if there should be an update, then it's triggered, otherwise the user needs to request it. I mean frankly, the AI could do this in the useChat right now probably... "Is the information worthy of being updated?" This might be tricky for a small model to get right on the fly... especially if doing it for every message? )

- Could refresh 1x per day?

- For updating, could simply grab every person with an interaction that happened that day, and the AI summary, and any reminders, and determine if there is anything worthy of being updated... This could get tricky as well...
- For updating, we'll start with just grabbing any people that have had interactions. Use a small model to determine if an update is needed, then run the bigger 01 model. I think we need o1 to do this because if I drop a massive note or a lot of notes, or upload a lot of images, the smaller model won't be able to handle it.

### Prompt Thoughts

- Should mention format & preferred style: bullet points, longer prose, etc...
- The number of sections and the content should only be as complex as the infomration available. If no information is available, then the output will be minimal. The amount that is returned should be suggestive of further action, value adds, and specific to the person and the user's relationship. If there's a lot of information, then feel free to be a little bit more verbose or thorough with the sections and information. Suggestions should still prompt further action, but should be high quality and more personalized.
- Make sure to highlight the AI parts of the For You section.
- Completeness should be a single number between 0 and 100.
- The sections should be in order of importance to the user.
- 0 - 25 is poor, 26 - 49 is okay, 50 - 79 is good, 80 - 100 is great.
- Scores of 0 - 25 have little no information or have unhelpful information
- Scores of 26 - 49 have more information, but still lots of room for getting to know the person on a deeper level.
- Score of 50 - 79 are pretty good. A lot of questions have information and the two people clearly know each other, but there is still another layer missing
- Scores of 80 - 100 are great. You know a ton about this person and clearly spent time with this person listening and learning about them as a person.
- Need to note that suggestions can be insights, questions that can be asked to get more clarity or interesting information, could be something interesting about the fact, i.e. he owns a chihuahua, "did you know that chihuahua's are the most popular dog in the united states?" Because that could be shared or interesting to share with the person.
- Key highlights should probably be a bulleted list of 2-3 key items to keep top of mind. Or 2 -3 concise sentences that can be read / scanned quickly.

- The following example data would probably be a 50 - 79 score because it has a lot of information and it's good to understand who Tim Cook is as a person, but it's lacking family history, hobbies, personal stories, values, pet names, person preferences on food, taste, etc... You probably don't know Tim Cook personally.

#### Technical Thoughts

- This probably going to need to use o1 to process.

- Therefore need a background job handler that can allow the user to "move on".

- We will need to queue the jobs in the frontend and track them on the client side.

- No... we can instead hand back a single record that has a "isProcessing" flag, when the job starts and then then finishes. The client can just "poll" for the record until it's finished.

- Want to try to vectorize and save the ai_summary as a vector embedding for rag search in the near future.
