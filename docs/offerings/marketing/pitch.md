1. I going to solve relationship management for entreprenuers and young executives.

These folks succeed based on the quality of their relationships. How many people know, like, and trust them.

And they know thousands of people, but memory and time degrade quality of the relationships quickly.

The main tools available are CRMs which are sales tools and not relationship tools. These folks are in sales, but not direct sales operations. So they need a tool like a CRM, but one designed specifically for them.

My first startup out of college was this exact problem, and I've tried dozens of systems, and I've probably missed dozens of opportunities over the years because I haven't been able to find a system that works.

That's where Superleader comes in.

Superleader is an AI first relationship manager that is designed to proactively find, nurture, and scale your network.

This is something that every executive would use, it just needs to work well, and AI finally makes that possible.
